145,"4. Electives (five courses required):
The major requires five additional elective computer science courses numbered 20000 or above. Students may enroll in CMSC 29700 Reading and Research in Computer Science and CMSC 29900 Bachelor's Thesis for multiple quarters, but only one of each may be counted as a major elective.
Courses numbered at CMSC 30000 level must be approved electives in order to satisfy the electives requirement for the major. Because these courses can change on a quarterly basis, they are not listed in the catalog. Please see the PhD Course Designation section of course-info.cs.uchicago.edu.
A small number of courses, such as CMSC 29512 Entrepreneurship in Technology, may be used as College electives, but not as major electives. Courses that fall into this category will be marked as such.
