Program Requirements
Both the BA and BS in computer science require fulfillment of the general education requirement in the mathematical sciences by completing an approved two-quarter calculus sequence.
To earn a BA in computer science any sequence or pair of courses approved by the Physical Sciences Collegiate Division may be used to complete the general education requirement in the physical sciences.
To earn a BS in computer science, the general education requirement in the physical sciences must be satisfied by completing a two-quarter sequence chosen from the General Education Sequences for Science Majors.
Students are encouraged, but not required, to fulfill this requirement with a physics sequence.
Students may petition to take more advanced courses to fulfill this requirement.
Both BA and BS students take at least fourteen computer science courses chosen from an approved program.
BS students also take three courses in an approved related field outside computer science.
A small number of courses, such as CMSC 29512 Entrepreneurship in Technology, may be used as College electives, but not as major electives.
Because these courses can change on a quarterly basis, they are not listed in the catalog.
Computer Science Major
The Computer Science Major Adviser is responsible for approval of specific courses and sequences, and responds as needed to changing course offerings in our program and other programs.
Students should consult the major adviser with questions about specific courses they are considering taking to meet the requirements.
There is one approved general program for both the BA and BS degrees, comprised of introductory courses, a sequence in Theory, and a sequence in Programming Languages and Systems, followed by advanced electives.
Students may substitute upper-level or graduate courses in similar topics for those on the list that follows with the approval of the departmental counselor.
The course information in this catalog, with respect to who is teaching which course and in which quarter(s), is subject to change during the academic year.
Introductory Sequence (four courses required):
Students who major in computer science must complete the introductory sequence:
CMSC 14100Introduction to Computer Science I100
CMSC 14200Introduction to Computer Science II100
CMSC 14300Systems Programming I100
CMSC 14400Systems Programming II100

Students who place out of CMSC 14300 Systems Programming I based on the Systems Programming Exam are required to take an additional course from the list of courses approved for the Programming Languages and Systems Sequence, increasing the total number of courses required in the Programming Languages and Systems category from two to three.
Students who entered the College prior to Autumn Quarter 2022 and have already completed part of the recently retired introductory sequence (CMSC 12100 Computer Science with Applications I, CMSC 15100 Introduction to Computer Science I, CMSC 15200 Introduction to Computer Science II, and/or CMSC 16100 Honors Introduction to Computer Science I) should plan to follow the academic year 2022 catalog.
Students who were unable to complete the retired introductory sequence before it was retired should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies for Computer Science or the Computer Science Major Adviser for guidance.

Because these courses can change on a quarterly basis, they are not listed in the catalog.
A small number of courses, such as CMSC 29512 Entrepreneurship in Technology, may be used as College electives, but not as major electives.
Courses that fall into this category will be marked as such.
Specializations
Students who major in computer science have the option to complete one specialization.
To do so, students must choose three of their electives from the relevant approved specialization list.
The graduate versions of the courses below can be substituted for their undergraduate counterparts.

CMSC 20370.
Inclusive Technology: Designing for Underserved and Marginalized Populations.
Creating technologies that are inclusive of people in marginalized communities involves more than having technically sophisticated algorithms, systems, and infrastructure.
It involves deeply understanding various community needs and using this understanding coupled with our knowledge of how people think and behave to design user-facing interfaces that can enhance and augment human capabilities.
When dealing with under-served and marginalized communities, achieving these goals requires us to think through how different constraints such as costs, access to resources, and various cognitive and physical capabilities shape what socio-technical systems can best address a particular issue.
This course leverages human-computer interaction and the tools, techniques, and principles that guide research on people to introduce you to the concepts of inclusive technology design.
You will learn about different underserved and marginalized communities such as children, the elderly, those needing assistive technology, and users in developing countries, and their particular needs.
In addition, you will learn how to be mindful of working with populations that can easily be exploited and how to think creatively of inclusive technology solutions.
You will also put your skills into practice in a semester long group project involving the creation of an interactive system for one of the user populations we study.

Machine Learning in Medicine.
In this course we will study the how machine learning is used in biomedical research and in healthcare delivery.
We will build and explore a range of models in areas such as infectious disease and drug resistance, cancer diagnosis and treatment, drug design, genomics analysis, patient outcome prediction, medical records interpretation and medical imaging.

Ethics, Fairness, Responsibility, and Privacy in Data Science.
This course takes a technical approach to understanding ethical issues in the design and implementation of computer systems.
Tensions often arise between a computer system's utility and its privacy-invasiveness, between its robustness and its flexibility, and between its ability to leverage existing data and existing data's tendency to encode biases.
The course will demonstrate how computer systems can violate individuals' privacy and agency, impact sub-populations in disparate ways, and harm both society and the environment.
It will also introduce algorithmic approaches to fairness, privacy, transparency, and explainability in machine learning systems.
Through hands-on programming assignments and projects, students will design and implement computer systems that reflect both ethics and privacy by design.
They will also wrestle with fundamental questions about who bears responsibility for a system's shortcomings, how to balance different stakeholders' goals, and what societal values computer systems should embed.

CMSC 29512.
Entrepreneurship in Technology.
Many of the most successful companies have been created by technologists, but many technologists fail to consider entrepreneurship as a viable career pathway because it is difficult to gain exposure to entrepreneurship.
Students in this class will experience, firsthand, new product development based on an idea conceived of by your group.
Your group will nurture your idea by clearly defining your product, obtaining market feedback, building an initial proof-of-concept, and pitching to investors.
While there is no requirement that your product become a new technology venture, this class is meant to serve as a launchpad for the first three months of a startup for those interested in pursuing their ideas further.
The fundamental belief, however, is that the entrepreneurial experience provided in this class can support you whether you develop new products in your large corporate enterprise or do pursue entrepreneurship in a startup of your own, and all students are encouraged to consider this course no matter your career trajectory or level of technical proficiency.

Sustainability and Computing.
Once a darling of the economy, the computing industry has come under fire as "techlash" brings a spotlight to its negative environmental and societal impacts.
We focus on understanding computing's environmental impact, and the productive and substantial (not greenwashing) actions that can be taken to reduce it.
The objective of this course is to expose students to a sophisticated view of how computing affects the environment, and how it can become more sustainable through action in several dimensions, including technology invention and design, business/ecosystem structure, individual and government action.
Students will be empowered with the intellectual tools to understand and act with insight on these issues in their professional careers.
